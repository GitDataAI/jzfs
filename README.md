# JZFS


#### 🚧 Current Status: Incubating - JZFS is not ready for production usage. The API is still evolving and documentation is lacking.

JZFS is a distributed git storage service for the Rust programming language that prioritizes ease-of-use. It supports both Single Machine as well as some distributed environments, including Kubernetes and more. Note that JZFS does not hide the store; instead, JZFS exposes features based on the target distributed git storage service.

### Current Status and Roadmap

JZFS is still in the early development stages and is considered **incubating**. There is no commitment to ongoing maintenance or development. As the project evolves, this may change in the future. Therefore, we encourage you to explore, experiment, and contribute to JZFS, but do not attempt to use it in production.

The immediate next steps for the project are to fill obvious gaps, such as implementing error handling, removing panics throughout the codebase, supporting additional data types, and writing documentation. After that, development will be based on feedback and contributions.
